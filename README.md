# IT TREASURE HUNT

## **â†’ What is it? ðŸ˜µ**

A game-like competition that will put oneâ€™s computer abilities to the test. The players will be entrusted with completing ten stages, each of which will contain a code buried somewhere on your PC and a hint as to where to look for it. Once the person has found the code for a level, he/she will be able to move onto the next level. As the game progresses, the levels will become more difficult and the codes will become more cryptic.  


## **â†’ How to play? ðŸŽ®**

By default, a folder named '1' will be provided to you within which you will find a video/image/file or, anything really. Using what we have provided, you have to hunt for the password for level 2. A total of 10 levels are there. With each correct passwords entered, a new file will be available to find the cluees for subsequent levels.
MAKE SURE YOU READ README file before opening the application!


## **â†’ Setup ðŸ’»**

â€¢ NOTE: the .py file is in the '1' directory. 

â€¢ Please make sure that `rich module` is installed on your system. 

â€¢ By default, only 1 folder should be visible.

â€¢ `View hidden items` should be unchecked in the file explorer (yes, other files are hidden. But please don't ruin the game for yourself)


## **â†’ NOTE ðŸ“Œ**

â€¢ The py file will be in the `1` folder. Keep the application running while you figure out the passwords.

â€¢ Edit the 10 folders with some sort of puzzle in each one of them, and set the passwords as per your choice by editing the py file.

â€¢ Don't forget to hide all the folders except the first one.
